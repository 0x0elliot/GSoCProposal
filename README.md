I believe that these resources should be open and accessible to the community. Let me know if you need any help with your proposal or getting involved with such programs. I hope you use them as a way of getting more involved in the open-source community! 
My friends have told me often, that they feel very lost, even after contributing a significant amount without a reference point. I am hoping that this old proposal can be something like that. 
I also hope open-source doesn't become the next leetcode with people selling courses and stays as open and approachable as it is.
